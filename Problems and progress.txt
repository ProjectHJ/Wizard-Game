Camera
Error in Game.java - 

	public void tick() {
		for (int i = 0; i < handler.object.size(); i++) {
			if (handler.object.get(i).getId() == ID.Player) {
				camera.tick(handler.object.get(i));
			}
		}
		
		handler.tick();
	}
	
handler.object.*;
object keeps erroring and i dont how to fix it, it must be a problem with the visibility of the Handler class
	but whenever i change the LinkedList in Handler.java to public it seems like it breaks everything.
	
	
Camera does not work like it should when i do make the LinkedList public so I don't know if those two are related.
Will continue series when I find a fix this problem.


Solved: Anytime I reference the LinkedList that referencing class needs to be in the same package as Handler.java
 as it can't find the Handler.java.
 
 Solved: Camera is now working. Player was moving too slow for the camera. Fixed!
